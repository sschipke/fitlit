## Matthew Malone and Scott Schipke

This is a partner project for Mod 2 of the Front En Engineering program for Turing School of Software and Design.

The goal was to take data provided to us and use it to make an activity tracker website/application that displays certain data, goals, and trends by day as well as over the course of a week for a specific user. 

We built this application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with jQuery and Chart.js for easier DOM interaction, manipulation, and display. We heavily employed OOP and classes here to manipulate and encapsulate our data. We tested the data manipulation/class methods using Mocha and Chai.

Our main goals with this project were to use ES6 classes, write dry modular JavaScript, practice and implement TDD and to manipulate and gather data using JavaScript array prototype methods.
